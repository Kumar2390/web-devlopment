      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable
        computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves
        tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the
        implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source
        code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine
        .</p>

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century,
        a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated
        mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[4][5] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a
        programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum
        patterns, via pegs and cams.[6][7] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by
        changing the "program" â€“ a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.

        Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi
        described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic
        Messages.</p>

      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Quality requirements
        Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The
        following properties are among the most important:[23] [24]

        Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of
        algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., buffer
        overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).
        Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations such as
        incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system
        services, and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.
        Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended
        purpose or in some cases even unanticipated .
